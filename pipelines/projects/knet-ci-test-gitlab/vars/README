Functions in here are specific to this project
the directory containing this one (ie projects/<project-name>)
should be added as a shared lib to the project under
"Pipeline Libraries".

For some features it might be worthwhile sharing this
code in the main sharedlib ~/vars or in a common library.
Bear in mind that the main ~/vars is the global shared
library for Jenkins and code in there is unsandboxed.
